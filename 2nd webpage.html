        Artificial intelligence: Nowadays we are just touching the tip of AI but we shall soon see what it is capable of. In 2050, There will be video games more real than life. You will see all movies of the theatre on your phone in 3d form. Your watches will be completely connected with all your devices and you can hear about the news of the entire world while jogging. You will be able to see footages in live 3d form of your cricket matches in your laptops.

        Construction Technology:
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays buildings are constructed by humans but in 2050, all constructions will be human-free. Robots will do the job quicker and better. Buildings will be 3d printed and they will be mesmerizing and beautiful.Wages will be minimum. Time will be least in constructing a building as if it child's play. So I end about construction in 2050 by saying that expect  construction of building being a subject taught in school.
